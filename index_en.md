## Robots in Strömberg park

~~On Saturday **{{ site.date }}** at 16 - 17.30~~

**2020 Event has been cancelled due to coronavirus situation.**

First time organized in 2016. Small robots try to find their way in a maze and bump against walls. Can they find their way to the goal line?

**Meet us at Strömberg park waterfall!**
